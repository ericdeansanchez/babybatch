# Baby Batch

## Overview

Baby batch is a simple client cli written in rust. Currently, this iteration _only_ supports requests from the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3).

This cli was made using [replicate](https://github.com/ericdeansanchez/replicate) via:

```zsh
  $ replicate cli babybatch 
```
